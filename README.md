# NES-Emulator
12/25/22 - making a Nintendo Entertainment Systems(NES) emulator because I enjoyed making that Chip8 emulator and I think I can learn so much from making a NES emulator. Its a tough project though(for me) so it'll take a while. 
12/30/22 - set up most of the header file, created the opcode table. i understand addressing modes now.
